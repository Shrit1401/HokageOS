Hokage os is a simple os where you can change the way you look at your old and boring home page no really it has the following features 

PS: I think I should not call it an OS after all it’s just a Chrome extension 

- 📁 add folders
- 📄 add files
- 🔴 add important links
- 🏆 motivation quote on the home page
- 📷 cool anime video in the background
- ☎️ retro style effect throughout the design

## The magic of this os is it’s fully customizable, you can pretty much change anything you want through code
